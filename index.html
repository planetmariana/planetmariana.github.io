								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 30px;"> Mapping the Sun’s active regions from SDO images to HARPS-N solar spectra </p>
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 20px;">
									Active regions are the main observable of magnetic activity in the Sun, these zones include structures such as faculae, sunspots and plage, the first two are located at the photosphere and the
									third one at the chromosphere, respectively. The aim of this work was to perform an analysis to
									determine if there’s any individual contribution to the relative spectra driven by Sun’s activity.
									Besides that, correlate the disc-integrated spectra (HARPS-N) with the spot and plage filling factors measured with images taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using a previous
									code (YAMORI, Cretignier et. al in prep), we found that there’s no clear evidence of sensitivity
									to sunspot-faculae activity due to an interference pattern and systematics from the detector. Nevertheless, an equivalent of a stellar surface-tomography analysis was performed during the process
									and it was possible to observe strong features in spectral lines affected by plage and spot at the
									same time.

								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 30px;"> Searching for disintegrating planets in the TESS data </p>
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 20px;">
									Catastrophically Disintegrating Exoplanets (CDEs) are Mercury-size rocky bodies that due to the
									close distance with their host star, these planets can heat up to high temperatures, allowing the
									sublimation of the planet’s surface. Only less than 10 exoplanet candidates has been confirmed as
									CDE’s in the last 10 years. Taking into account that these planets have very short periods (4-30hr),
									observations could miss/confused them with other big planet transits and stellar phenomena. In
									this case, we are looking to identify this type of transits using light-curves from TESS telescope
									data. Through the implementation of a pipeline, we can detect them in an automatically way,
									we use an exponential model that considers a set of orbital parameters that are fit through an
									optimization method. This one, was selected from three different routines tested during the work.
									Finally, we evaluate the entire method in 500 systems from which we obtain a final list of candidates
									for CDE’s

								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 30px;"> 2D/3D simulations for the episodic thermal convection on Enceladus ice shell </p>
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 20px;">
								 In this research we investigate how Enceladus,one of Saturn's most important moons maintains the heat observed by Cassini spacecraft.
								 The existence of an episodic thermal convection in the Enceladus crust is proposed, with numerical models of finite elements in spherical
								 coordinates, which include geodynamical parameters such as tidal forces, a non-uniform viscosity in the crust and a type of convection under
								 a layer not convective. In addition, it is included in the model that the convection is taking place episodically, giving rise to events of
								 maximum heat transport in a span of a few million years and a consequent stability, allowing that the high heat flow can be explained as the
								 release of heat stored in the past. The model is designed to obtain an energy value close to the data obtained by the Cassini mission.

								<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 20px;">
								A spectroscopic study of planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars was carried out, with the help of the Echelle spectrograph
								present in the observatory of the Universidad de los Andes. There, data of more than 8 nights distributed between the months of
								January, February and March of 2019 were collected. The calibration images were reduced in order to avoid the noise and unwanted
								signals in the data coming from external sources, as required Observational spectroscopy. For this reason, a calibration star
							  (HD101501) and calibration lamps (Thorium-Argon-Tungsten) were used to comply with the optimal reduction steps. Subsequently,
								the reduced spectrum of the Sun was obtained, which was subtracted from the spectrum of the other bodies in order to identify
								absorption spectrum morphologies of various rock-forming minerals present in the Moon and Mars.

								These brightness measurements were taken in the city of Bogotá with the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) measuring instrument,
								 from these measurements the brightness behavior during the month of March and April was studied, when a seasonal
								 transition occurs in the Cundiboyacense highlands. The data were correlated with the civil aeronautical meteorological station,
								 concluding that the month of April had a greater number of clear nights than the month of March, which presented a continuous presence
								 of clouds. On average, the astronomical observation time with completely clear skies is 30 and 60 minutes for March and April respectively.

								I've been always interested on helping the astronomical community in my country to develop and expand to territories with underrepresented communities.
								For this, I joinned the Colombian Network of Astronomy Students (RECA), which is an association that aims to create spaces that allow the exchange of 
								ideas and significant experiences among its members, where mutual support prevails for the realization of various academic and social impact projects.
								One of these projects that I'm involved in as an orginizing committee member, is the Mentorship program. A program designed to help BSc. students to get into a gradutate program and guide 
								them with the application process in a 1-1 weekly meetings. With the mentors being colombian astronomers working on highly recognized institutions all 
								around the world.

								 Also, following this line of DEI activities, I'm part of the Colombian Network of women working in astroscience (CHIA) by its initials in spanish. In this group
								 we are working for make more visible the work done by colombian women researchers, and try to reduce the gender gap in academia. Specially, in astronomy. In this scenario, we have 
								 worked in several activities such as divulgation events, census, collaborations with other women association and now we're working to stablish a relationship between 
								 CHIA and the Ministry of Science to stablish new gender-equality policies on science.

						<p>Astronomy is my passion, I have always oriented my academic interests

						  As a gift, I received my first professional camera hoping to capture the Milky Way Center with my own techniques.
							Today I can say that I made it!. All my photo gallery take place in different landscapes in Colombia

						<p>  Astronomy has interested me deeply since I was a child. With this in mind,
							I started my undergraduate program in Physics. Then, I began to feel extremely passionate about studying
							the planets and how they could help me to understand the formation and evolution of the solar system and
							conditions to harbor life there. For that reason, I decided to start simultanously a second major in Geoscience. My favorite hobbies are photography, camping, hiking and exploring the amazing
							and unique nature in my country (Colombia), what makes me so privileged person, because in Colombia, we have since the jungle to the glaciers at the Andean mountains.
